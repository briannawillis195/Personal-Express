<b>Description</b>: It's Showtime! Full stack application that allows you to enter shows or movies that are currently on your to-watch list. Once you have watched the show, you can click the check mark and it will be placed on the Finished Watching list. A great place to keep track of everything you've been planning to watch.

<b>Tech Used</b>: EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS and MongoDB

<b>Lessons Learned</b>: This project was a bit challenging to do at first. I had the idea in my head but being able to execute the code and have it do exactly what I wanted proved to be more difficult than I imagined. With help from a mentor, I was able to get the shows from the Watch-List to Finished watching by utilizing CSS.
